# Getting started with basic modern JavaScript
In this repo I develop several simples samples of using modern JavaScript to getting started to work with Angular, Node & React.

## Test it
This project is an React project so you need to run
~~~
npm install
~~~
make sure to take the example that you want to test from the directory **"src/bases"** and move it to the **"src"** directory with the name **"index.js"**, and then run.
~~~
npm start
~~~
